Gangup Manhunt! Includes development server kit as well.

# Development Guide
This repo comes with a development server. Just run either start.bat or start.sh depending on your operating system.
Dependencies:
1. Java (To run the server, I'd recommend 11 or 14)

After making a change to the datapack, use /minecraft:reload
When increasing versions, disable old datapacks.
